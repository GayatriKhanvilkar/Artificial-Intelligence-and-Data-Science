It is machine learning based project which uses machine learning approach to find sentiment analysis of mobile product reviews. Python packages like NLTK, re, Scikit-learn, bs4, pandas and numpy etc. are used for pre-processing, labeling and cleaning of data, applying machine learning algorithms and performance evaluation tasks.
This project explores and compares the performance of Machine Learning Algorithms such as Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, Logistic Regression, SVM Classifier, Decision Tree and Random Forest. In this, using achieved sentiment polarity and product features tried to suggest top five recommendations.
